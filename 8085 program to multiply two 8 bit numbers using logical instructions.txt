8085 program to multiply two 8 bit numbers using logical instructions



code:
MVI B 05	B <- 05
MVI C 04	C <- 04
MOV A, B	A <- B
RLC	rotate the content of A without carry
RLC	rotate the content of A without carry
STA 3050	3050 <- A
HLT	End of the program



Explanation â€“

MVI B 05: assign the value 05 to B register.
MVI C 04: assign the value 04 to C register.
MOV A, B: move the content of register B to register A.
RLC: rotate the content of accumulator left without carry.
RLC: rotate the content of accumulator left without carry.
STA 3050: store the content of register A at memory location 3050
HLT: stops the execution of the program.
