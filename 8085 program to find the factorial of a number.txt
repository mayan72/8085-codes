Explanation â€“

First set register B with data.
Set register D with data by calling MULTIPLY subroutine one time.
Decrement B and add D to itself B times by calling MULTIPLY subroutine as 4*3 is equivalent to 4+4+4 (i.e., 3 times).
Repeat the above step till B reaches 0 and then exit the program.
The result is obtained in D register which is stored in memory
