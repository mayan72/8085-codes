8085 program to subtract two 8-bit numbers with or without borrow


MVI	C, 00	[C] <- 00
LHLD	2500	[H-L] <- [2500]
MOV	A, H	[A] <- [H]
SUB	L	[A] <- [A] – [L]
JNC	200B	Jump If no borrow
INR	C	[C] <- [C] + 1
STA	2502	[A] -> [2502], Result
MOV	A, C	[A] <- [C]
STA	2503	[A] -> [2503], Borrow
HLT		Stop



Explanation – Registers A, H, L, C are used for general purpose:

MOV is used to transfer the data from memory to accumulator (1 Byte)
LHLD is used to load register pair directly using 16-bit address (3 Byte instruction)
MVI is used to move data immediately into any of registers (2 Byte)
STA is used to store the content of accumulator into memory(3 Byte instruction)
INR is used to increase register by 1 (1 Byte instruction)
JNC is used to jump if no borrow (3 Byte instruction)
SUB is used to subtract two numbers where one number is in accumulator(1 Byte)
HLT is used to halt the program
