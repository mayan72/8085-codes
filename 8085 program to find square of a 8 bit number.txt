8085 program to find square of a 8 bit number



code:
2000	MVI H 20	H <- 20
2002	MVI L 50	L <- 50
2004	MVI A 00	A <- 00
2006	MOV B, M	B <- M
2007	ADD M	A <- A + M
2008	DCR B	B <- B – 01
2009	JNZ 2007	Jump if ZF = 0
200C	STA 3050	M[3050] <- A
200F	HLT	END


Explanation – Registers used A, H, L, B and indirect memory M:

MVI H 20 – initialize register H with 20
MVI L 50 – initialize register L with 50
MVI A 00 – initialize accumulator A with 00
MOV B, M – moves the content of memory location which is indirectly specified by M in register B
ADD M – add the content of memory location which is indirectly specified by M in accumulator A
DCR B – decrement value of register B by 1
JNZ 2007 – jump to memory location 2007 if ZF = 0, i.e register B does not contain 0
STA 3050 – stores value of A in 3050
HLT – stops executing the program and halts any further execution
