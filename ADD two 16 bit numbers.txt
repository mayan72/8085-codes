8085 program to add two 16 bit numbers

LDA 2050	A ← 2050
MOV B, A	B ← A
LDA 2052	A ← 2052
ADD B	A ← A+B
STA 3050	A → 3050
LDA 2051	A ← 2051
MOV B, A	B ← A
LDA 2053	A ← 2053
ADC B	A ← A+B+CY
STA 3051	A → 3051
HLT	Stops execution


Explanation:

LDA 2050 stores the value at 2050 in A (accumulator).
MOV B, A stores the value of A into the B register.
LDA 2052 stores the value at 2052 in A.
ADD B add the contents of B and A and store them in A.
STA 3050 stores the result in memory location 3050.
LDA 2051 stores the value at 2051 in A.
MOV B, A stores the value of A into the B register.
LDA 2053 stores the value at 2053 in A.
ADC B adds the contents of B, A, and carry from the lower bit addition and store in A.
STA 3051 stores the result in memory location 3051.
HLT stops execution.
